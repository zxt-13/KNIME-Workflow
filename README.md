Medical AI KNIME Workflow and Dataset
This project includes a KNIME workflow with six medical AI application case studies, aiming to provide visual teaching support for AI education in the medical field and help students master AI technologies without prior programming experience. The workflow covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, and evaluation, focusing on solving real-world medical problems.
Project Objectives

This project helps students learn how to apply artificial intelligence tools to analyze clinical data, medical imaging, and drug data without prior programming experience by building and sharing six KNIME workflows across six medical fields. These workflows cover the following areas:

Multidimensional Feature Visualization of Iris Dataset
Preliminary Data Analysis
Multi-Disease Association Rule Mining
Breast Cancer Risk Prediction
Pathological Image Segmentation via Deep Learning
Drug Molecular Feature Engineering and Machine Learning Screening
